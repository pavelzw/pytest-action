# GitHub Action for pytest

This GitHub Action allows you to run pytest and output [GitHub Job Summaries](https://github.blog/2022-05-09-supercharging-github-actions-with-job-summaries/). For creating the job summaries, this action uses [pytest-md](https://github.com/hackebrot/pytest-md) and [pytest-emoji](https://github.com/hackebrot/pytest-emoji).

```yaml
- name: Run pytest
  uses: pavelzw/pytest-action@v1
  with:
    verbose: true
    emoji: true
    job_summary: true
    custom_arguments: '-q'
```

You need to have Python as well as pytest installed in your pipeline before you can run this action. If `job_summary` is set to `true`, you also need to install `pytest-md`. If `emoji` is set to `true`, you need to install `pytest-emoji`.

If you want to change the time zone of the job summary, you may want to use the [szenius/set-timezone](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-timezone) action:
```yaml
- name: Set timezone
  uses: szenius/set-timezone@v1
  with:
    timezone: 'Europe/Berlin'
```

When `job_summary` is set to `true`, the action will output a Job Summary.
